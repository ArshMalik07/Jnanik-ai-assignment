## Movers Listening


## Tapescript

R  Hello. This is the University of Cambridge Movers  Listening Test. 
Look at Part One.  Look at the picture.  Listen and  look. 
There is one example. 
M 	 Excuse me.  What are you all doing? 
Fch 	 We’re drawing and painting on this wall. 
M 	 Oh.  A wall picture!  Are these all your friends? 
Fch 	 Yes.  But one is my brother, John. 
M 	 Is he the boy who’s painting a rainbow? 
Fch 	 Yes, you’re clever!  How did you know? 
M 	 His hair is blond, like yours. 
R  Can you see the line? This is an example.  
 Now you listen and draw lines. 
One 
M 	 That’s a beautiful rainbow. 
Fch 	 Yes, it is.  John’s very good at painting. 
M 	 Who’s the girl that’s helping to paint it? 
Fch 	 The one who’s standing on a box? 
M 	 Yes. 
Fch 	 That’s Sally. 
R  Two 
M 	 Who’s the boy that’s painting the leaves? 
Fch 	 Which one? 
M 	 The one with jeans and a blue T-shirt. 
Fch 	 Oh, he’s called Peter. 
M 	 I love those leaves! 
R  Three 
Fch 	 Look at Daisy. 
M 	 What’s she doing? 
Fch 	 She’s bringing a box of drinks for the children. 
M 	 Oh yes!  I’m thirsty.  Can I have a drink, please? 
R  Four 
M 	 One boy isn’t painting.  He’s taking photos of the  children. 
Fch 	 The one with the purple shirt? 
M 	 Yes. 
Fch 	 That’s Jim.  He likes taking photos more than  painting. 
M 	 Mmmm. 
R  Five 
M 	 Who’s the girl who’s having a drink? 
Fch 	 The one with the curly hair? 
M 	 Yes. 
Fch 	 That’s my best friend, Jane. 
M 	 Why isn’t she painting? 
Fch 	 Well, she’s hot and tired, I think. 
R  Now listen to Part One again. 
 That is the end of Part One. 
Part Two.  Listen and look. There is one example. 
F 	 What’s your homework today, Paul? 
Mch 	 I’ve got to write about the zoo. 
F 	 When did you go to the zoo?  Was it last Tuesday? 
Mch 	 That’s right.  Last Tuesday. 
F 	 Well, that’s easy, then. 
Mch 	 Is it? 
R  Can you see the answer?  Now you listen and write. 
One 
F 	 How many different kinds of animals did you see at  the zoo? 
Mch 	 That’s difficult. 
F 	 Well, think about it. 
Mch 	 Oh…thirty, I think. 
F 	 Thirty! Good. 
R  Two 
F 	 What were the biggest animals that you saw? 
Mch 	 Erm… the giraffes, I think. 
F 	 Weren’t there any elephants? 
Mch 	 Oh yes, that’s right.  The elephants were the biggest! 
R  Three 
F 	 So, which animal did you like best in the zoo? 
Mch 	 I liked them all. 
F 	 Which was your favourite?  The lions? 
Mch 	 No, I liked the birds.  The parrots were my favourite. 
F 	 The parrots? 
Mch 	 Yes.  They were beautiful.  They were in a very  big cage. 
R  Four 
F 	 What do they eat? 
Mch 	 Well, they like all kinds of fruit. 
F 	 Did you give them some fruit?

## Movers    Listening

Mch 	 Yes we did.  They loved it! 
R  Five 
F 	 Oh, yes, one last thing – what was the name of the  zoo? 
Mch 	 Wild Zoo. 
F 	 How do you spell that? 
Mch 	 W-I-L-D. 
F 	 Oh yes, I know it.  Good.  Well, now you can start  your homework. 
R  Now listen to Part Two again. 
That is the end of Part Two. 
Part Three. Look at the pictures. What did Sally do  last week? Listen and look. There is one example. 
M 	 Hello, Sally. Did you have a good holiday last week? 
Fch 	 Not bad.  Sunday was good.  I flew my kite! 
M 	 Where did you do that? 
Fch 	 In the park. 
R  Can you see the line from the word Sunday? 
   On Sunday, Sally flew her kite in the park.  
   Now you listen and draw lines. 
One 
M 	 What did you do on Saturday? 
Fch 	 I went for a long walk with my mum and dad.  We  took our dog with us. 
M 	 Did you enjoy it? 
Fch 	 It was OK, but it was very windy that day.  In the  evening, we were all tired. 
R  Two 
M 	 Did you go shopping last week, Sally? 
Fch 	 Yes, we did.  We went to the shops in town on  Monday afternoon.  I bought a present for my  grandpa. 
M 	 Did you drive into town? 
Fch 	 Yes.  The weather was terrible that day and we didn’t  want to walk. 
R  Three 
M 	 And what did you do on Thursday, Sally? 
Fch 	 Which day? 
M 	 Thursday. 
Fch 	 Oh, I rode my bike in the park. 
M 	 With your friends? 
Fch 	 That’s right. 
R  Four 
Fch 	 I went shopping again on Wednesday! 
M 	 Did you? 
Fch 	 Yes, but I didn’t go to town that day.  I only went to  the shop in the village. 
M 	 What did you buy? 
Fch 	 Oh, we needed some bread and milk. 
M 	 Did you walk there? 
Fch 	 Yes, it’s very near. 
R  Five 
M 	 Which was your best day last week? 
Fch 	 Friday, I think. 
M 	 Why?  Did you go shopping again? 
Fch 	 No!  I don’t go shopping every day, you know!  I  invited my favourite cousin to come and play with  me. 
M 	 Oh.  That was good.  What did you do with her? 
Fch 	 We took our dogs for a walk in the fields.  It was very  hot that day. 
M 	 Great! 
R  Now listen to Part Three again.
   That is the end of Part Three. 
Part Four. Look at the pictures. Listen and look. 
   There is one example. 
Where did Jim see the film? 
Mch 	 I saw a good film last week. 
F 	 Oh, did your Mum take you to the cinema? 
Mch 	 No… 
F 	 Was it at your school, then? 
Mch 	 No, it was at my birthday party. 
F 	 Oh, I see! 
Mch 	 It was a DVD. 
R  Can you see the tick? Now you listen and tick the  box. 
One.  Where did the rabbits in the film go? 
Mch 	 The film was about some rabbits. 
F 	 Oh.  I know the one.  They have to find a new home.   Did they go to live with the animals in a zoo? 
Mch 	 No, they didn’t do that! 
F 	 Oh.  Well, did they go to a farm then? 
Mch 	 No.  They went to live in a big forest. 
R  Two.  Where did the children have their lunch? 
F 	 What did you do after the film? 
Mch 	 We all had lunch. 
F 	 In a café? 
Mch 	 No.  We had a picnic. 
F 	 Where?  In the park? 
Mch 	 No, we had it in my garden. 
R  Three.  What did the children eat? 
F 	 What did you have for your lunch?  Sandwiches? 
Mch 	 No, we had burgers.

## Movers    Listening

R  Four.  What did the children do after lunch? 
F 	 What did you do after lunch?  Did you have the  birthday cake? 
Mch 	 No, we played ball games in my garden. 
F 	 Oh!  It’s better to play quiet games after a big lunch. 
Mch 	 Not on my birthday! 
R  Five.  What did Jim’s friends give him? 
F 	 What did your friends give you for your birthday? 
Mch 	 Oh, a lot of things. Some of them gave me CDs. 
F 	 Did they give you any new books? 
Mch 	 No.  But my best friend gave me something very  good. 
F 	 What is it? 
Mch 	 It’s a little kitten! 
F 	 Wow! 
R  Now listen to Part Four again.
 That is the end of Part Four. 
Part Five.  Look at the picture. Listen and look. 
   There is one example. 
M 	 Can you see the teacher? 
Fch 	 Yes, I can.  She’s helping the boy. 
M 	 That’s right.  Look at her hair. 
Fch 	 Yes, it’s curly! 
M 	 That’s right.  Colour the teacher’s hair yellow. 
Fch 	 OK. 
R  Can you see the teacher’s yellow hair? 
   This is an example. 
Now you listen and colour and write. 
   One 
M 	 Now, do you want to colour something? 
Fch 	 Yes, please.  Can I colour the clock? 
M 	 OK, what colour? 
Fch 	 Blue is my favourite. 
M 	 OK, that’s a good colour for the clock, then. 
R  Two 
M 	 Now, would you like to write something for me? 
Fch 	 What?  A word? 
M 	 Yes, can you see the map on the wall? 
Fch 	 Behind the teacher? 
M 	 That’s right.  Can you write the word MAP below it? 
Fch 	 OK.  I’m writing that now. 
R  Three 
M 	 Right. Can you see the boy’s sweater? 
Fch 	 Yes, it’s got a star on it. 
M 	 That’s right. 
Fch 	 Can I colour the star? 
M 	 Yes, good idea! 
Fch 	 What colour? 
M 	 Green. 
Fch 	 Fine. 
R  Four 
M 	 Now, can you see the comic? 
Fch 	 Which one? 
M 	 The comic on the boy’s desk. 
Fch 	 Oh, yes.  I can’t colour all of it. 
M 	 Yes, you can.  Do it quickly! 
Fch 	 What colour? 
M 	 You choose. 
Fch 	 OK.  I’m doing it red … 
R  Five 
M 	 One last thing now … what can we have? 
Fch 	 I don’t know.  Oh, can I colour the eraser?  The one by  the pencil. 
M 	 Yes, colour that eraser brown, please. 
Fch 	 OK.  That’s all. 
M 	 Yes.  Well done!  The picture looks great now! 
R  Now listen to Part Five again. 
That is the end of the Movers Listening Test.

## Summary of Procedures

The usher introduces the child to the examiner. The examiner asks how old the  child is. 
1 	 The examiner asks the child to describe several differences between the two Find  the Differences pictures, e.g. ‘This is a bird but this is a cat.’ 
2	 The examiner tells the child the name of the story and describes the first picture  e.g. ‘Fred is sad. He can’t play football. His ball is very old. His mum’s saying,  “Take the dog to the park.” ’ The examiner then asks the child to continue telling  the story. 
3	 The examiner demonstrates how to do this task with the first set of four odd-oneout pictures and then asks the child to choose one picture in the other three sets  and say which is different and why. For example, ‘These are all animals, but this is  a sweater.’
